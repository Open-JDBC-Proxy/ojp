# Support Policy

This document describes which versions of Open J Proxy receive active maintenance and for how long.

---

## Supported Versions

| Version line | Status   | Support type          | End of support |
|---|---|---|---|
| `1.0.x`      | **LTS**  | Bug + security fixes  | 3 years from `1.0.0` GA release (targeting August 2029) |
| `main` / latest | **Current** | All changes | Rolling — no fixed end date |

---

## LTS line: `1.0.x`

`1.0.x` is the first **Long-Term Support** release line of Open J Proxy.

### What the LTS line receives

- Bug fixes
- Security fixes
- Critical compatibility fixes (e.g. Java LTS runtime compatibility)
- Necessary dependency updates to address published CVEs

### What the LTS line does NOT receive

- New features
- Breaking changes
- Unnecessary refactoring
- Non-critical dependency upgrades

All backwards-compatible new features go to `main` and produce `1.1.0`, `1.2.0`, etc.
Breaking changes go to `main` and produce `2.0.0` when they justify a major release.

## Branch and tag model

```
v1.0.0 (tag)
  │
  ├── lts/1.0 ──── v1.0.1 ──── v1.0.2 ──── v1.0.3 ──── ...
  │
  └── main ──────── v1.1.0 ──── v1.2.0 ──── ... ──── v2.0.0
```

- `lts/1.0` is the maintenance branch for the 1.0.x line.
- Individual releases are immutable tags (`v1.0.1`, `v1.0.2`, …).
- `main` is the active development trunk.

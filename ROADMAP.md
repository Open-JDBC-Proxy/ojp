# OJP Roadmap

This document outlines the planned releases and key milestones for the Open J Proxy project.

---

## ✅ Version 0.4.0-beta — March 2026 (Released)

**Theme: Service Provider Interfaces & Query Enhancement**

- Full implementation of OJP Service Provider Interfaces (SPIs), enabling custom connection pool providers and extensibility hooks
- Spring Boot integration via spring-boot-starter-ojp with automatic datasource configuration
- Official TestContainers integration module for reproducible integration testing
- Mutual TLS (mTLS) support between the JDBC driver and OJP server
- Expanded observability: additional OpenTelemetry metrics and distributed tracing spans
- Improved developer experience: refined configuration, better error messages, and expanded documentation
- Enhanced test coverage and integration testing infrastructure
- Experimental integration with [Apache Calcite](https://calcite.apache.org/) for SQL query optimization (disabled by default)

---

## 🔄 Version 0.5.0-beta — June 2026

**Theme: Read/Write Segregation & Caching**

- Read/write segregation support: route read queries to replicas and write queries to primary nodes automatically
- Query result caching layer to reduce database load for repeated read operations
- Configuration-driven cache invalidation and TTL policies
- Client-side throttling for failing fast when the system is overloaded.

---

## 🎯 Version 1.0.0 — September 20, 2026

**Theme: Production Ready (LTS)**

- First stable, production-grade release — no longer beta
- Full SPI ecosystem with stable public APIs
- Performance benchmarks and tuning guides
- Comprehensive documentation covering all features, deployment patterns, and upgrade paths
- **Long-term support (LTS) begins**: `1.0.x` receives bug fixes and security patches for 3 years
- LTS branch `lts/1.0` created from the `v1.0.0` tag
- Development on `main` continues toward `1.1.0`

---

## 🚀 Version 1.1.0 — planned

**Theme: Post-LTS feature cycle**

- First feature release after the 1.0.0 GA
- Backwards-compatible new features added to `main`
- `lts/1.0` continues to receive maintenance patches in parallel

---

## 💡 Future Considerations (post 1.0.0)

Items under consideration for future releases:

- Native reactive/non-blocking driver support
- gRPC streaming improvements for high-throughput workloads
- Kubernetes operator for automated OJP cluster management
- Support for additional connection pool providers via SPI
- `2.0.0` only when breaking changes justify a new major version

---

## Versioning policy

Open J Proxy follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):

| Version segment | When it changes |
|---|---|
| MAJOR | Breaking, API-incompatible changes |
| MINOR | Backwards-compatible new features |
| PATCH | Bug and security fixes |

See [`documents/VERSIONING.md`](documents/VERSIONING.md) for full details and branching rules.
See [`SUPPORT.md`](SUPPORT.md) for the support and LTS maintenance policy.
